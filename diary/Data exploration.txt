Distributions TODO:
    - TODO: Time series plot of total_respiratory_admissions over time
    - TODO: Histogram of AQI metrics (aqi_mean, aqi_p90, aqi_max)
    - TODO: Missingness rates for admissions fields and AQI coverage (days_reported)

Missingness/anomalies TODO (If there is anything you think should be added):
    - Some admission vals are missing (NaN) for certain weeks/states, especially early in the CDC time range
    - days_reported varies. Low values indicate limited AQI reported coverage that week and should be considered in later modeling.
    - We removed non-U.S. "Country Of Mexico" state entries from AQI aggregation prior to merging.
