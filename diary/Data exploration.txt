Row/Column counts:
    - cdc_m1: 19229 rows x 6 columns
    - aqi_m1: 13,080 rows x 8 columns
    - merged_m1: 13,080 rows x 10 columns

Statistics:
    - Missingness statistics pertaining to missing rates (when values are recored as NaN or NULL) of applicable variables will be measured
    - Skew statistics and Kurt statistics will be utilized to determine distribution shape and skew of all examined variables in the final dataset

Distributions:
    - Histograms displaying simple summary statistics relating to values and their respective frequencies (counts)
    - Total Admissions Over Time (plot of weeks vs. total respiratory admissions)
    - AQI Mean Over Time (plot of weeks vs. aqi mean values)
    - Extra: Total Admissions and AQI Mean Values over time for state of Florida (proof of concept over narrower scope)

Missingness/anomalies TODO (If there is anything you think should be added):
    - Some admission vals are missing (NaN) for certain weeks/states, especially early in the CDC time range
    - days_reported varies. Low values indicate limited AQI reported coverage that week and should be considered in later modeling.
    - We removed non-U.S. "Country Of Mexico" state entries from AQI aggregation prior to merging.
