Access:
The data we found and will be using for our problem is publicly available.

Sources:
  Dataset One - CDC NHSN “Weekly Hospital Respiratory Data (HRD) Metrics by Jurisdiction.”
  Center for Disease Control
  - Contains weekly aggregated hospital respiratory admissions and capacity metrics at the state/territory level.
  - We selected a subset of columns relevant to admissions: total COVID-19 admissions, total influenza admissions, total RSV admissions.

  Dataset Two - EPA AQS AirData “Daily AQI by county” files (multiple years)
  Environmental Protection Agency
  - Contains daily AQI values by county/state. We aggregate daily values to weekly state-level metrics.

How We Obtained the Data:
    We obtained the data via download from the respective websites online.

How You Obtain the Data:
    - Data is downloaded programmatically via scripts:
        scripts/download_cdc_hrd.py downloads the CDC dataset as CSV.
        scripts/download_epa_aqi_daily.py downloads and unzips annual EPA AirData files for daily AQI by county.

Both sources provide reliable, publicly available data from trusted government agencies.

Relevance:
    Both datasets are directly needed to answer our problem statement. Our variables taken as input will come directly from the two datasets.
    CDC provides weekly respiratory burden while EPA provides air quality exposure. Combined, they enable analysis of whether higher AQI weeks correspond to higher respiratory admissions.

Constraints:
    The EPA files are large and not stored in git. Raw data lives locally under data/raw/ and is reproducible via scripts.
