Database purpose:
    - Store cleaned, integrated Milestone 1 tables in a single SQLite database for reproducibility and downstream analysis.

Database engine:
    - SQLite (single file: data/processed/milestone1.db)

Tables:
    - cdc_m1: weekly admissions by state (COVID/Influenza/RSV and total).
    - aqi_m1: weekly AQI metrics by state (mean, p90, max, and days_reported).
    - merged_m1: inner join of cdc_m1 and aqi_m1 on (state, week).

Keys:
    - Logical primary key for all three tables is (state, week).

Implementation:
    - Tables are written using pandas to_sql() function during the notebook run. The .db file is created automatically by SQLite if it does not exist.
